# Recents

Launcher-agnostic "Recents" menu for Android.

## How to use
### Launch last app
Assign the app to a custom shortcut (e.g. double-click of the power button) in your system settings.
Trigger the shortcut.
App will transfer you to the last used app (as if the "recents" navbar button was double-clicked).
Simple as.
### Launch "Recent apps" view
The app includes a custom shortcut, which (or its activity, `RecentAppsActivity`) can also be assigned to a custom shortcut, using any shortcut assigner (e.g. [KeyMapper](https://github.com/keymapperorg/KeyMapper))

## Announcement
This project is looking for testers!
My personal phone is no longer rooted, and thus I cannot test the whole functionality.
I invite you to compile the latest repo and raise all encountered issues.
